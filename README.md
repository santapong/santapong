# Hi, I'm Santapong 👋

I build systems that turn data into decisions — and I’m exploring how **AI engineering** and **quantum computing** might reshape what “compute” even means.

- Background: **Software Engineer** + **Data Engineer**
- Current focus: **AI Engineering**, **MLOps-minded production work**, and **Quantum Computing fundamentals**
- I enjoy: clean architecture, measurable experiments, and shipping things that work
